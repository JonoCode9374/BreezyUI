# BreezyUI
Many Python users who work with graphical interfaces know the pains of designing and creating a Graphical User Interface with Python’s built-in graphics library tkinter (Tkinter in Python 2 and tkinter in Python 3) – creating interfaces requires intense planning (getting the co-ordinates for where each widget goes), lots of trial and error. This is what I have personally experienced many times, making programs such as my SpamBot, DocEdit and my Head Scruiteneer Program. To solve these problems experienced by many a programmer, regardless of experience, I will be making a GUI maker called BreezyUI©. BreezyUI will allow users to drag-and-drop tkinter widgets in a WYSIWYG style to make the user interface they want, much like the storyboarding feature used in Xcode.
