# BreezyUI
Many Python users who work with graphical interfaces know the pains of designing and creating a [Graphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) with Python's built-in graphics library `tkinter` (`Tkinter` in Python 2 and `tkinter` in Python 3)  -- creating interfaces requires intense planning (getting the co-ordinates for where each widget goes), **lots** of trial and error. To solve these problems experienced by many a programmer, regardless of experience, I will be making a GUI maker called _BreezyUI&copy;_. BreezyUI will allow users to drag-and-drop `tkinter` widgets in a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) style to make the user interface they want, much like the storyboarding feature used in Xcode.

# What's new in BreezyUI b1.1.0
- Backwards compatibility for Python 2 started
- Attributes area window shows when widget right-clicked and hides when `Done` button clicked
- Changed the code to incorporate classes
- Added option to export python code for GUI (*TODO: Only export the necessary attributes*)
- Added more changeable attributes

# What's New in BreezyUI b1.0.0
- 3 core widgets added (`Label`, `Button` and `Entry`)
- Ability to edit the text displayed on widgets
- Started trying to make the background colours of widgets changeable (**WIP**)
