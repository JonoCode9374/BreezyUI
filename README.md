# BreezyUI
Many Python users who work with graphical interfaces know the pains of designing and creating a [Graphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) with Python's built-in graphics library `tkinter` (`Tkinter` in Python 2 and `tkinter` in Python 3)  -- creating interfaces requires intense planning (getting the co-ordinates for where each widget goes), **lots** of trial and error. To solve these problems experienced by many a programmer, regardless of experience, I will be making a GUI maker called _BreezyUI&copy;_. BreezyUI will allow users to drag-and-drop `tkinter` widgets in a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) style to make the user interface they want, much like the storyboarding feature used in Xcode.
