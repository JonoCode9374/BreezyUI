# BreezyUI
Many Python users who work with graphical interfaces know the pains of designing and creating a [Graphical User Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) with Python's built-in graphics library `tkinter` (`Tkinter` in Python 2 and `tkinter` in Python 3)  -- creating interfaces requires intense planning (getting the co-ordinates for where each widget goes), **lots** of trial and error. To solve these problems experienced by many a programmer, regardless of experience, I will be making a GUI maker called _BreezyUI&copy;_. BreezyUI will allow users to drag-and-drop `tkinter` widgets in a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) style to make the user interface they want, much like the storyboarding feature used in Xcode.

# Whatâ€™s new in BreezyUI b1.2.0
* The text in the `Entry` widget is now fully changeable
* Started adding home screen (Only `Create` button works)
* Exporting code only exports the changed attributes, and also places the widgets in their positions

* When background colour of labels are changed, the label is updated accordingly

# What's new in BreezyUI b1.1.0
