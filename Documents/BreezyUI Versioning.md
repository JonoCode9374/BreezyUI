## What Constitutes a Patch Release
A **patch release** is when an issue with a minor release is fixed. For example, if the location of a widget in the widgets area was off by a few pixels, the fix would be uploaded in a patch release. For a patch release to be uploaded:
* At least 3 trivial changes have had to be made
* Nothing minor was changed in the release, only bugfixes
* No new features were changed in the release

## What Constitutes a Minor Release
A **minor release** is when minor features are added/removed from the program. For example, if there were requests for another language to be added to the export choices, then the addition would be uploaded in a minor release. For a minor release to be uploaded:
* At least 5 minor changes have had to be made
* Nothing major was changed in the release, only minor features
* The changes made don't change the existing feel of the major release too much

## What Constitutes a Major Release
A **major release** is when _BreezyUI_ is **really** changed -- the layout, the way widgets are modified, etc... all would be found in a major release. For a major release to be uploaded:
* At least 3 major changes have been made

## Pre-releases
A **pre-release** is when either a major or minor version is in development, and people want early access to the new version. For a pre-release to be uploaded:
* At least 1 minor/major change must have been made
